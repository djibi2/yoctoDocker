This is a dockerized build environment for Yocto images to run on i.MX boards for NXP. The environment supports publishing to GITHUB releases.

The scripts / dockerized setup in this repository are open source. Please make yourself familiar with the build results (images) corresponding licenses. The build images are available within the release section.

A lot is based on the [i.MX Yocto Project User's Guide Linux](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/i.MX_Yocto_Project_User's_Guide_Linux.pdf):
